ORDER BY
========
Order By clause is used to arrange the records either in ascending order or in descending order.

Syntax:
SELECT column-name
FROM table-name
ORDER BY column-name ASC/DESC;

Characteristics of ORDER BY clause
-----------------------------------
> By default, the table will be arranged according to Primary key in ascending orders.
> ORDER BY clause is the last executable clause.
> It executes after the SELECT clause.
> We can pass multiple columns inside ORDER BY clause.
Whenever we pass multiple columns, it prioritize the column which has been given first.
