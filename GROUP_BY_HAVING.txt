========
GROUP BY
========
GROUP BY clause is used to group the reocrds.

Characteristics of GROUP BY clause
==================================
> It executes row by row.
> It will convert row records into group records.
> GROUP BY clause executes after FROM clause if there is no WHERE clause.
> After execution of GROUP BY clause, other clauses will execute group by group.
> We can pass multiple columns inside GROUP BY clause.
> We can display aggregate functions and group-by-expressions.

Note: group-by-expressions are the columns passed inside GROUP BY clause.

Syntax:
------
SELECT aggregate_function, group_by_exp
FROM table_name
[WHERE filter_condition]
